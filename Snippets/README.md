# Snippets

### Broken Snippet

Due to Telegrams Update to Invite Links the [Resolve Invite](resolve_invite_link.py) Snippet is currently broken.
I have no idea when a fix will be coming. We first need to know how these new invite links are built to be able to unpack them.
Until then, you'll just get an error message when you run that snippet: `unpack requires a buffer of 16 bytes`.

Here is a list of all Snippets for better overview and a clearer top-level Readme.

All snippets assume you have a `config.ini` with [your api id and hash set up][API].

<sup>1: Iterating through a lot of messages might take some time.<br>
2: This includes Supergroups, as Telegram handles them the same internally.<br>
3: This has been [shared by !null in the Pyrogram Inn][FLOOD].<br>
4: Disclaimer: Keep that Session String SAFE. Anyone who has that key, can log in as you.<br>
5: This has been [shared by James Santagato in the Pyrogram Lounge][FLIP].<br>
6: Useful if you need the ID of people who have no messages left in your chat (eg join-message removed by bot).<br>
7: This will download profile photos individually, which creates a LOT of requests to Telegram. You might find yourself flood-limited.<br>
